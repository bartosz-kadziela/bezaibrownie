            Meet Beza and Brownie - our two beloved bunnies!
        </p>
        <p class="py-4 leading-8 text-justify">
            Their names come from types of desserts: chocolate Brownie and Meringue, which also correspond to their colours: brown & white. Beza is: agile, curious, and fearless, whereas Brownie is: calm, kind, and cautious. They are both very friendly, hungry, and in need of petting (often together at the same time).
        </p>

            It was in August 2022 when, just after moving into our new flat, I and my wife Paulina decided to have a bunny. When we saw photos of 6-weeks-old Beza, the decision to make her part of our family was simple and swift :)
        <p class="py-4 leading-8 text-justify">
            However, we quickly concluded that one bunny is not enough. Despite spending time with Beza each day, we could see that she started feeling lonely, especially when I and Paulina were out working.
        <p class="leading-8 text-justify">
            As a result, in January 2023, we adopted 4-year-old Brownie from a foundation. In the beginning, we were afraid that the age difference between Beza and Brownie might become troublesome during their befriending, but fortunately, this was not the case, and they are happily living together now :).
