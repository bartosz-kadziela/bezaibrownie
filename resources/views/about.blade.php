        Beza has truly captured our hearts as our first bunny, becoming a cherished member of our family since her arrival in August 2022 from a bunny breeding. At just 6 weeks old, she was a pure white bundle of joy. As time passed, her colors transformed, and now she exhibits a delightful blend of white with subtle grey elements on her ears, nose, and tail.
        <br><br>
        Beza is a cheerful, active, and curious bunny. She always enjoys different activities and has a few favorite things that keep her happy and entertained.
        Lately, she found the bottom shelf in our bathroom cabinet and started digging, probably because it makes her happy and taps into her natural rabbit instincts.
        <br><br>
        Beza is incredibly friendly, and unlike many bunnies, such as Brownie, she rarely gets scared. This could be attributed to the daily affection she receives and the immense love we have for her. Additionally, having her with us since she was very young might have played a significant role.
        <br><br>
        Beza's diet is centered around hay, dried herbs, and water. In addition to these essentials, she enjoys some special treats:
        <ul class="p-4">
            <li class="list-disc text-2xs md:text-lg xl:text-xl leading-4 xl:leading-8">
                <span class="font-semibold">Apple</span> (daily, along with her medications)
            </li>
            <li class="list-disc text-2xs md:text-lg xl:text-xl leading-4 xl:leading-8">
                <span class="font-semibold">Pear or banana</span> (weekly)
            </li>
            <li class="list-disc text-2xs md:text-lg xl:text-xl leading-4 xl:leading-8">
                <span class="font-semibold">Tomato or cucumber</span> (weekly)
            </li>
            <li class="list-disc text-2xs md:text-lg xl:text-xl leading-4 xl:leading-8">
                <span class="font-semibold">Others</span> (occasionally)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="md:pt-4 text-2xs text-justify md:leading-8 xl:leading-10 md:text-lg xl:text-xl">
        Of course, she receives limited portions, typically just a small chunk of these snacks.

        Brownie

        Brownie became a new, beloved member of our family in January 2023. We adopted him from a foundation when his previous owners no longer wanted him, which saddened us. At the time, Brownie was already 4 years old, reaching middle age for a bunny that typically lives around 8-10 years.
        <br><br>
        Introducing Brownie to Beza required a gradual approach to prevent any territorial issues. Initially, we placed Brownie in a different room, allowing both him and Beza to sense each other's presence and become familiar with their scents. After about 2 weeks, we moved Brownie into the same room but kept him in a separate cage. Occasionally, we opened their cages simultaneously, facilitating their gradual adjustment to one another. Eventually, after a few weeks, they began sharing a cage harmoniously.
        <br><br>
        Initially, Brownie displayed a reserved and cautious demeanor, often reacting nervously to sounds and movements. He also had a different dietary preference, possibly influenced by a previous unsafe grain diet from his former owners. Adapting to the new environment and food took some time. Brownie required (and still enjoys) plenty of affection and playtime. It was essential for us to convey that he's safe with us and free from any harm.
        <br><br>
        These days, Brownie is a content and cheerful bunny. Although he might be a bit less active than Beza, it could be attributed to his age. Nonetheless, he adores playtime, enjoys being petted, and occasionally joins Beza for a leisurely outing.
        <br><br>
        His favourite food is similar to that of Beza, however he is definitely less picky and eats more hay :)
